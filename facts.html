          <h1>SOME FACTS AND FIGURES</h1>


    <h4>1. By 2024 India will overtake China as the world’s most populous country</h4>


      <p>China currently has 1.4 billion inhabitants, closely followed by India with 1.3 billion. Together they make up 37% of the world’s population.</P>
      <h4>2. Nigeria has the world’s fastest growing population</h4>
      <p>Nigeria is currently 7th on the list of most populous countries, but before 2050 it will have made third place, overtaking the US.

        <br>1 China 1 397 029</br>
        <br>2 India 1 309 054</br>
      <br>3 United States of America 319 929</br>
    <br>4 Indonesia 258 162</br>
  <br>5 Brazil 205 962</br>
<br>6 Pakistan 189 381</br>
<br>7 Nigeria 181 182</br>
<br> 8 Bangladesh 161 201</br>
<br>9 Russian Federation 143 888</br>
<br>10 Japan 127 975</br></p>
<h4> 3. Fertility has fallen all over the world</h4>
<p> Since the 1960s, the global birth rate has fallen to an average of 2.5 births per woman. However, that average is made up of highly diverse figures: in Africa its 4.7 births per woman, in Europe it’s 1.6 births per woman.</p>
<h4>4. Half of the population growth will take place in 9 countries</h4> 
<p> From 2017 to 2050, India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the United States of America, Uganda and Indonesia will contribute the most to population growth.

  This means that the population of Africa is set to roughly double between now and 2050.
  
  <h4>5. Europe’s population will decline</h4>
  <p>When fertility falls below 2.1 births per woman it’s deemed “below‐replacement”. That means that not enough babies are being born to replace their parents’ population. This is already happening in Europe.</p>

  <h4>6. Almost half the world’s population live in countries with low fertility</h4>
  <p>Between 2010 and 2015, 46% of the world’s population lived in 83 countries where the fertility level was below the threshold of 2.1.</p>

  <h4>7. The world is getting older</h4>
  <p>An increasing number of people are living to a ripe old age. In 1950, there were far more young than old. In 2017, there are fewer young and more older people. By 2050, the numbers will even out.
